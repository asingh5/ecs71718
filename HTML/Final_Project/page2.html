              <h2>family</h2>
                <p>I've always loved my family. They're more important to me than I am. I would do anything for anyone in my family. When people act as if their parents have done nothing for them, it makes them sound clueless. Seriously, saying that your hate your mom or don't like them is some of the dumbest stuff I've ever heard. Everone in your family has sacrificed everything for you. Not lying, this is one of the things I am most passionate about. I value, appreciate, and cherish every second I spend with them. I know that loving your family and respecting your family is the right way to go at it. Value your family. The best thing that you can do is be there for them, becuase they're the only people that'll be there for you. </p>

              <h2>early life</h2>
                <p>I was born on March 30, 2004, in Weiss Memorial Hospital on Chicago's north side. I like to tell my mom that I gave her myself as her birthday present since her birthday is the 28th. I grew up with my older brother, Gurluv, for my whole life. I've lived in Skokie and the north side of Chicago for my whole life. My early life is fairly simple, but I like it that way. I've always put education before other stuff, like sports or videogames, although they do come close. I guess I still am in my early life, but the "early" label is starting to expire.</p>

              <h2>hobbies</h2>
                <p>I like sports. Like, all of them. It's just that feeling of freedom that you get from being able to run around and being able to beat people at something. There's a quest for superiority and proving to people that you're physically better than them. It feels good. Along with that, I like debating (see my academics page for more) because I always beat everyone at it. I also enjoy learning and acquiring knowledge to show off how smart I really am. Sometimes I just sit down and pick up a notepad and try to write something deep or fire. Writing is so powerful. “Let us pick up our books and our pens, they are the most powerful weapons.”  Malala Yousafzai said this once and I completely agree. I love the power words and wordplay. I always try to write something using this power. The power of words is also what gives me a knack for rap. The lyrical rappers that tell a story through constant literary strategies opens a secret door in the back of your brain that's only opened by stuff that's pure and true. I try to get the key to that door through my constant writing.</p>

              <h2>skills</h2>
                <p>I like to believe that I'm good at sports. I don't know, I'm okay, I guess. I do play a lot so than does mean that I have some skill in basketball, baseball, lacrosse, and running. However, my real skill is in the educational part of my life. I'm really good at any kind of writing (argumentative, free, poetry, literary, persuasive etc.). Along with that, my math skills are up there as well.</p>
