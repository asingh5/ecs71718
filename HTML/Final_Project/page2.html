              <h2>family</h2>
                <p>I've always loved my family. They're more important to me than I am. I would do anything for anyone in my family. When people act as if their parents have done nothing for them, it makes them sound clueless. Seriously, saying that your hate your mom or don't like them is some of the dumbest stuff I've ever heard. Everone in your family has sacrificed everything for you. Not lying, this is one of the things I am most passionate about. I value, appreciate, and cherish every second I spend with them. I know that loving your family and respecting your family is the right way to go at it. Value your family. The best thing that you can do is be there for them, becuase they're the only people that'll be there for you. </p>

              <h2>early life</h2>
                <p>I was born on March 30, 2004, in Weiss Memorial Hospital on Chicago's north side. I like to tell my mom that I gave her myself as her birthday present since her birthday is the 28th. I grew up with my older brother for my whole life. I've lived in Skokie and the north side of Chicago for my whole life. My early life is fairly simple, but I like it that way. I've always put education before other stuff, like sports or videogames, although they do come close. I guess I still am in my early life, but the "early" label is starting to expire.</p>

              <h2>hobbies</h2>
                <p>I like sports. Like, all of them. They're really enjoyable and fun. Along with that, I like debating (see my academics page for more) because I always beat everyone at it. I also enjoy learning and acquiring knowledge to show off how smart I really am. Sometimes I just sit down and pick up a notepad and try to write something deep or fire. Writing is so powerful. “Let us pick up our books and our pens, they are the most powerful weapons.”  Malala Yousafzai said this once and I completely agree. I love the power words and wordplay. I always try to write something using this power. The power of words is also what gives me a knack for rap. The lyrical rappers that tell a story through constant literary strategies opens a secret door in the back of your brain that's only opened by stuff that's pure and true. I try to get the key to that door through my constant writing.</p>

              <h2>skills</h2>
                <p>I like to believe that I'm good at sports. I don't know, I'm okay, I guess. I do play a lot so than does mean that I have some skill in basketball, baseball, lacrosse, and running. However, my real skill is in the educational part of my life. I'm really good at any kind of writing (argumentative, free, poetry, literary, persuasive etc.). Along with that, my math skills are up there as well. I've always been able to grasp new ideas quickly and I'm really good at comprehending stuff. I'm diligent in my work and my priorities are somewhat straight. I'm a good listener and I'm compassionate, which can be good or bad. Everything I hear is taken seriously, which could be my greatest strength or my biggest weakness.</p>

              <h2>sports</h2>
                <p>I've played many sports over the years. As described in my hobbies page, I really like them.  It's just that feeling of freedom that you get from being able to run around and being able to beat people at something. There's a quest for superiority and proving to people that you're physically better than them. It feels good. Especially with an element of competitiveness, it brainwashes you into trying your hardest just to say "I beat you." Nonetheless, they're also really healthy and they're a good way to spend time and make friends, so why not do them. Along with that, I love watching sports and basically anything to do with them.</p>

              <h2>likes</h2>
                <p>I like the Spring and Summer because you don't need a jacket and it's nice outside and it's my birthday and you can go places and there's vacation and the pros can go on and on. Going outside and shooting a basketball in my backyard gives me such a high. I like picking up a pencil and a notebook and writing. I like playing videogames, sports and strategy ones mostly.I like going to school becuase I get to see my friends and I become smarter, so it's a win-win. I love being with my family since it gives me great energy and a lot of laughter. I just like positive stuff because it fuels my mood positively.</p>

              <h2>dislikes</h2>
                <p>I don't like the Winter and Autumn, because I'm always sick and there's finals and it's a harder commute and the cons can just go on and on. I'm not one of those privileged losers who complain about every little thing, as I can deal  with a simple setback. I really dislike those people. I'm an introvert, so I don't like "hanging out" or seeing people that I know outside of school. I don't like tons of homework becuase that makes my chronic procrastination even worse. I don't like staying up late or anything that's "rebellious". </p>

              <h2>currently</h2>
                <p>I'm currently an 8th grader in Lane Tech's Academic Center. I'm 5'10", 145 lbs, and am the president of LTAC's student body. I still live up to everything written above and I strive for the best for myself and my family. I'm a religious Sikh and I take my health seriously. I workout regularly and try to be the best version of me. I still have a crazy amount of things that I can and will improve on, but I always try to be a nice, honest person. I've always been pretty down-to-earth in my opinion and a bit of a braggart but I'm always getting better and pushing to be fulfilled.</p>
