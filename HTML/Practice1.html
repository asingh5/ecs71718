                Mahatma Gandhi was a man who fought for and won India's independence when India was under the rule
                of Great Britain. <br/> 
                <strong>He was a man who stressed to be peaceful and harmless while still standing
                up for what's right.</strong>  <br/>
                <color>He is an inspiration for many activists after him, such as Martin Luther
                King Jr.</color>
